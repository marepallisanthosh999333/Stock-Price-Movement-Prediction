- Transaction costs: 1% round-trip
- Break-even needed: ~75% accuracy
- Result: Likely negative returns after costs
```

#### 2. **Risk Factors**
```
🚨 High Risk Elements:
- Market regime changes can break models
- Black swan events not captured in training data
- Overfitting to historical patterns
- No real-time validation of predictions
```

#### 3. **Implementation Gaps**
```
🔧 Missing Production Elements:
- Real-time data feeds
- Order execution systems
- Risk management controls
- Portfolio position sizing
- Performance monitoring
- Automated retraining
```

### 🛡️ **If You Insist on Trading (Not Recommended)**

#### **Minimum Safety Requirements**
1. **Paper Trading First**: Test for 6+ months with no real money
2. **Tiny Position Sizes**: Risk only what you can afford to lose completely
3. **Professional Oversight**: Consult qualified financial advisors
4. **Risk Management**: Implement stop-losses and position limits
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Track performance degradation
6. **Legal Compliance**: Ensure regulatory compliance in your jurisdiction

#### **Reality Check Questions**
```
❓ Ask Yourself:
- Do I understand why 58% accuracy might lose money?
- Have I tested this on truly out-of-sample data?
- Can I afford to lose my entire investment?
- Do I have professional risk management systems?
- Am I prepared for the model to fail completely?
```
